        <summary>I haven't played Patapon game before. Can I play it?</summary>
        <div class="detail-block">
        <div class="detail-block-bg"></div>
            Of course! The game contains tutorials. You can also change the difficulty on the settings.
        </div>

    <details>
        <summary>How do I open the game?</summary>
        <div class="detail-block">
        <div class="detail-block-bg"></div>
            Unzip the downloaded file, and open <em>PataRoad.exe</em>.<br>
            Note that the unzipped game size is 1GB, so check if you have enough free space.

        <summary>The spear/arrow is randomly thrown too fast.</summary>
        <div class="detail-block">
        <div class="detail-block-bg"></div>
            It's known issue. Well, I tried many things, but it still does.<br>
            I can't fix it, but it's very low chance, so shouldn't affect to the game playing.
        </div>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>I found a bug. Can I report it?</summary>
        <div class="detail-block">
        <div class="detail-block-bg"></div>
            Maybe?<br>
            Well, nobody blocks reporting, but the fixing requires "next version", so cannot be fixed so fast.<br>
            Also, if you can't reproduce the steps, there is high chance of that the bug cannot be fixed.<br>
            Another note: if it's a bug, if it doesn't affect much gameplay, it'll be fixed slowly or won't fixed.<br>
            Every bug has priority!<br>
            And Some of the things you thought it's bug, can be actually "feature/by design" ;)

        <summary>The level is too easy/impossible!</summary>
        <div class="detail-block">
        <div class="detail-block-bg"></div>
            About half of the game progress is easy, if player can play very well. Try difficult play mode - better reward is bonus!<br>
            If the game is too difficult, first, change your strategy. Try different classes or/and summoning boss.<br>
            If characters die easily, make your army stronger. Develop Rarepons and/or equipments. Check the tips again.<br>
            I tried going through all levels in legit way, so I'm sure that there is no impossible level.

        <summary>Do you have any guide for the game?</summary>
        <div class="detail-block">
        <div class="detail-block-bg"></div>
            Not right now :(<br>
            But if you want, you can make the game guide, and also I can make guide on demand.
        </div>

    <details>
        <summary>The game graphic/animation is not good enough.</summary>
        <div class="detail-block">
        <div class="detail-block-bg"></div>
            First, I'm not an artist. Second, it's focused on functionality.<br>
            Third, after all, it's not original game. So I can do nothing with it anymore.
        </div>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Do you have any future support of the game?</summary>
        <div class="detail-block">
        <div class="detail-block-bg"></div>
            It depends. If people don't play the game or there is nothing to fix, I have no reason to update.<br>
            Since the patch or update checking system isn't supported at all, if there is any future update, it won't be performed frequently.
